Munin plugin for the Motorola Surfboard 6120 Cable Modem
===========================

Description
====
This script uses the Munin monitoring framework to graph SNR (signal-to-noise) ratios of your 
SB6120 cable modem. This script will handle the possible multiple bonded channels your cable modem
can use with your ISP.

Installation
====
Copy the scripts into /etc/munin/plugins and restart your munin-node service. 
Several iterations of the munin-cron service will need to run for graphing to start.
